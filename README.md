# Flask App Seed
This is a very basic seed for a flask app that that can be used to show how js, html, css, and python work together to build a full stack web app

## Getting Started
Just click run and the basic app will be shown

## Developing the App
Update any of the files, and the app should automatically reload showing the updated app. Occasionally, it seems that the app will fail to load in the embeded browser window, but stopping the app and running it again typically resolves the issue. 

## Sharing the App
When the app is running, anyone can access the app via the url shown in the embeded browser

## Thing to Try
1) Can we store things in the provided "database" and see those changes in the app no matter who views it?
2) Can we add some unit tests? That might be interesting for a TDD/Kata approach
